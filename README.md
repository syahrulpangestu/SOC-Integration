# Wazuh---MISP-Integration
Wazuh &amp; MISP Integration for IoC 
# Wazuh â†” MISP Integration Script

## Overview
This script enables integration between **Wazuh** (SIEM) and **MISP** (Malware Information Sharing Platform) to:
- Automatically extract **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** from Wazuh alerts.
- Query MISP using the `/attributes/restSearch` API.
- Append matched IoCs back into Wazuh events for correlation.
- Optionally save matched IP addresses into a local list for further actions (e.g., blocking).

## Features
- Secure TLS connection with optional CA bundle.
- Retry & timeout for API calls.
- POST request with filters to MISP `/attributes/restSearch`.

- Safe file append with duplicate prevention.
- Robust JSON parsing for incomplete or custom alerts.
